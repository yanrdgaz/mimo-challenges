# Create a simple inventory program for a shirt store. The program should increase the sales variable by 1 and
# decrease the inventory variable by 1 when a shirt is sold. Tasks (2): Between the variable initialization and the
# print statements, increase the value of the sales variable by 1 using an operator. Decrease the value of the
# inventory variable by 1 using an operator.

sales = 0
inventory = 10

sales += 1
inventory -= 1

print(f'Sales: {sales}')
print(f'Inventory: {inventory}')
