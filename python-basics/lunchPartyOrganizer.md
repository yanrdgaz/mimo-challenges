Project Lunch Party Organizer: In this project, you're coding a program to help you organize a lunch party for your friends.

1. You'll serve pizza to the guests of your party. Let's create a variable and store the menu item inside. Tasks (2): Create a menu_item variable. Assign the string value "pizza" to menu_item.

2. 10 guests confirmed they are coming to your party. Let's create another variable to keep track of the number of guests. Tasks (2): Create a guests variable. Assign it a value 10.

3. Before the guests arrive, let's check the menu and the number of people coming to make sure we prepare enough food. To display the values stored in the variables we created, let's use print statements. Tasks (2): Print the variable menu_item. Print the variable guests.

4. You just received a call from one of the guests and they told you that they are allergic to cheese! To ensure everyone's safety, let's replace the menu item with biryani instead. Biryani is a delicious dish made with meat or vegetables, rice, and a variety of flavorful spices. Tasks (1): Update the menu_item to "biryani".

5. Let's make sure we updated the menu! We can use a print statement to do that. Tasks (1): Print menu_item to the console using an expression. The result should be as follows: Updated menu item is: biryani

6. It's time to calculate how much biryani you need for 10 guests. Start by creating a variable to store the amount of biryani for a single person. Then calculate the amount of biryani we need for 10 guests. Tasks (4): Create a biryani_per_person variable. Assign it a value 1. Create a biryani_needed variable. Set biryani_needed equal to biryani_per_person multiplied by guests.

7. You ordered the biryani after calculating how much biryani you are going to need for 10 guests, and it is just delivered to your place. You counted the biryani you received. Now let's store the number of biryani you have just counted in a new variable. Tasks (2): Create a biryani_prepared variable. Assign it a value 10.

8. Let's check if we have enough biryani using the equality operator. Tasks (3): Create an enough_biryani variable. Use the equality operator to check if biryani_prepared is equal to biryani_needed. Assign the result of the equality operator in step 2 to the newly created enough_biryani variable.

9. The guests just started to arrive and you realized that one of them has brought their sibling to the party too. Let's update the number of guests in our program. Tasks (1): Add 1 to guests.

10. To ensure everyone gets a portion of biryani, let's calculate how much biryani we need to serve each guest. Tasks (3): Create a biryani_per_guest variable. Set biryani_per_guest equal to biryani_prepared divided by guests. Use a print statement to display biryani_per_guest to the console.

Woohoo! You just created a program that helps you organize parties. Feeling motivated? You can play around with the code and experiment with it. Maybe, try calculating biryani_needed again for 11 guests or add more than one menu_item. Be creative and play with the code you just wrote to build muscle memory!
