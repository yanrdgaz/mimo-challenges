# Your friend has a youtube channel. They asked you to figure out how well their channel is doing. Let's find their best and worst videos!
# Tasks (3):
# Create a mostViewed variable, and assign the value "7 Amazing Mugs I CANNOT live without" to it.
# Create a leastViewed variable, and assign the value "The Best Mug to Take Scuba Diving" to it.
# Use two print statements to output these variables in the console, each on a different line. Make sure the output is the following:
# 7 Amazing Mugs I CANNOT live without
# The Best Mug to Take Scuba Diving

mostViewed = "7 Amazing Mugs I CANNOT live without"
leastViewed = "The Best Mug to Take Scuba Diving"

print(mostViewed)
print(leastViewed)
